# McDonnell Douglas DC-10
This is a simulation of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 for FlightGear. It is on hold in the very early stage of development due to needing a complete 3D modelling overhaul, which I am not able to do.

Present pack includes the following McDonnell Douglas DC-10 variants:
- DC-10-30 (GE CF6-50C2)
- DC-10-30F (GE CF6-50C2)
- DC-10-40 (PW JT9D-59A)
- DC-10-40F (PW JT9D-59A)
- KC-10A (GE CF6-50C2)
- KDC-10-40 (PW JT9D-59A)

FlightGear 2020.3.14 or later is supported. For more info, please see the [project wiki page](https://wiki.flightgear.org/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10).
