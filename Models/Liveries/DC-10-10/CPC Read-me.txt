     Canadian Pacific Airlines DC-10-30 livery by E-Savageair

     In 1942, Canadian Pacific Railroad purchased ten bush airlines including Canadian Airways to form
Canadian Pacific Air Lines.  The airline grew steadily with traffic through the 1950's even while limited 
by the government.  In 1968 to align the company with Canadian Pacific's other subsidiaries under it's new 
"Multimark" logo, Canadian Pacific Air Lines became CP Air along with companies, CP Hotels, CP Ships, 
and later CP Rail.  The airliners were given a new bold orange and red scheme that if seen from the top, 
looked the Multimark logo stretched on the fuselage that's also on the tail. 
     
     Despite federal restrictions where it battled for market share and international agreements with 
government-owned Trans-Canada Air Lines, (later to become Air Canada) CP Air would still fly 38 
destinations out of its hub from in Vancouver, British Columbia by creating its own overseas routes to 
Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Sydney. By the late 70's, those routes became lucrative and the federal 
government lifted restrictions on CP Air.  It continued operations till 1987 when it was combined with 
Nordair and Pacific Western to become Canadian Airlines.

     Among its 68 fleet of 737, DC-8, and 747 aircraft CP Air also owned a fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30's 
like C-GCPI depicted here from 1977 to 1987 when Canadian Airlines took over operations. (That same 
aircraft would also wear the new Canadian Airlines "chevron" livery included in the aircraft download package.)
