# INSTALL
## Prerequisites
Have at least following versions installed:
* FlightGear 2024.1.1 or newer

## Install using ZIP Snapshot
[Download](https://github.com/Octal450/DC-10/archive/master.zip) the zip file.  
Use your prefered archive utility to unzip the archive.
Move the unpacked directory to your aircraft directory. This can be FGData/Aircraft, or a custom directory you've specified.

Rename the directory to `DC-10`.
Make sure that the `DC-10` directory does not contain another one (this can happen with WinRAR). If so, move the inner `DC-10` directory outside.

To update, delete the `DC-10` directory and install the latest version.

## Install using git
Change to the aircraft directory.
Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Octal450/DC-10.git`

To update just run `git pull` in the `DC-10` directory.
